Adobe,"i regret ever getting involved with adobe. after reading all the negative reviews, i now understand why people are frustrated. their plans are impossible to cancel without facing excessive cancellation fees. support is unprofessional and unreliable—they either leave the chat or can't provide answers. my advice: if you're already stuck with them, the only way out is to block your card, get a new one, and never deal with them again.",2 days ago,1.0

Adobe,"1* is far too much for this company. i took out a free trial to convert one document, cancelled before the end date and received an email to confirm. just checked bank account and found they have taken 2 months money for another service i did not sign up for. nearly an hour on their chat bot, repeating this is fraud on their behalf. offered to cancel, waive cancellation fees and would refund one months money. told them no and eventually got acccount closed, no cancellation fee and both months refunded. i thought adobe was a reputable company obviously not - beware",3 days ago,1.0
Adobe,"i wish there was an international business ethics committee keeping tabs on businesses like adobe and other monopolist extortionists. while the rest of us are living from pay to pay, they seem to be doing a great job of increasingly profiteering from their ongoing existence, while screwing the rest of us out of our own financial existence. they and others like them obviously won't change because they don't need to.",3 days ago,1.0

Adobe,"my husband signed up for their free trial because it was the only way to finish a single document we needed to close on our home. he forgot to cancel it and so we got charged for the month after the 7days. he then proceeded to cancel the subscription. we paid for that month we forgot to cancel. next month we see a pending charge from adobe. we call customer service and they proceed to tell us there were two subscriptions and we only canceled one (and of course it was the large bill we didn’t cancel). we stay on the line trying to get it cancelled and to stop the charge or get refunded. customer service then hung up on us without even canceling the subscription. mind you, we never even got notified either time that the subscription was going to renew. i then called customer service back and they told me we cannot get refunded because we passed the 14 day refund date. how does that work? our subscription renewed the 10th of july and i called on the 14th. how is that past the 14 days? terrible customer service.",6 days ago,1.0

Adobe,"in 2010, i purchased a lifetime license for adobe acrobat. the product was properly paid for and activated at the time, and i used it without any issues for years. however, approximately six months ago, the software began displaying messages stating that the license key had been revoked. while the program still opens, it constantly prompts me to enter a valid key and occasionally closes documents unexpectedly.i contacted adobe support, and the only solution offered was to provide proof of purchase. but we’re talking about a purchase made 15 years ago — very few people keep receipts for such long periods, especially for a lifetime license, which by definition should not expire or be deactivated.it appears that this was a deliberate deactivation of valid keys, likely based on the assumption that most users would be unable to prove their purchase after so long. worse still, adobe now only offers me subscription-based options (monthly or annual), which i consider an abusive practice.i paid a significant amount at the time for a perpetual license. now, with no prior notice, i am being denied access to what i legally purchased and am being pressured to switch to a subscription model.i respectfully demand that my original license be reactivated, or that i be provided with a new perpetual key, as per the original agreement.",9 Jul 2025,1.0

Adobe,product works okay but cheaper better options out there. they try and lock you in to 2 year fees when leaving and then charge a cancellation fee. not worth it with other softwares to use,2 Jul 2025,2.0
Adobe,"the software is fine and has always been fine. my review is about customer experience. adding an extra user license takes seconds. easiest thing in the world. removing a license is a pain in the ass and they purposefully make you jump through hoops to get it done. there's early cancellation fees if you want to remove a license before 'contract expiry' and free cancellation is only possible within a termination window. i get that you want to maximize company revenue but adobe has done so, consistently, at the expense of giving customers a product/service they actually enjoy using. we have a flexible team and we may need more licenses for a product occasionally for a short time. unless you want to get stuck paying for these licenses for a year or more, even if nobody is using them, do not use adobe. adobe's disregard of user experience makes sure that at the earliest possibility i will switch to comparable software with a better pricing and more license/user flexibility. this way of doing business is not the future.",2 Jul 2025,1.0

Adobe,"adobe took away the right to own one's software, effectively increasing the price of their tools a thousandfold. they also reserve the right to take away these tools at anytime and have done that to an entire country in the past. their focus is primarily on advertising and spending their time developing their products for their own ends and not that of their customers. the adobe 'experts' at hand to answer questions are the kapo that serve their masters and not their fellows. overall adobe is in my opinion an unethical company who will go down on the wrong side of history for caring more about power and excess wealth than people.",25 Jun 2025,1.0

Canva,"canva has the worst customer service. period. here's just two examples.1. i wrote to their support dept that something with their newsletters that was not working, and i had been trying for months. i even was working with 2 different it depts, and the issue came back to it being a canva problem. canva acknowledged this and kept sending me status reports of that they have no update. zero. hilarious. then months go by and they send me one last message that they just don't know and are moving on from helping. that's it. bye.2. my employer is insisting that i work with canva and they refuse to understand that the canva support team are not working with me to resolve the issue. like what company would do this so they send me to the canva create conference 2025. i attend this costly event. i wait in line to get one on one help. the gal working the line (ashley) acknowledges that canva is not working correctly whatsoever for me. i even took a video of her saying this for me to send me boss. she took my info and promised to get to the bottom of the issue. i never heard back from her again. a few weeks later i wrote to canva yet again and asked for her and even sent her photo as i do not know how many ashley's are employed there and i did not get her last name as i trusted her to get back to me. my bad. i never heard from canva again.the worst!!!!!!!!!!!!",4 days ago,1.0

Canva,"tldr:terrible customer support. issue began on mar 21st 2025 no resolution of any sort until april 6th 2025. their fix of something broken on their end would require me to redo hours worth of work.full:issues with functionality happen all the time which is fine and typically get fixed in the background after a few days so wait and it's mostly back.this time unfortunately the issue was not resolved so i contacted support. note i was paying for a pro subscription. i was uploading long videos of clients,  cropping them down and tweaking the playback speed. i then interspersed these clips with static slides with text. i have done this many many times before. this time,  the video clips came out upside down with the text the right way up. there was nothing wrong with or upside down about the original video. because the videos were bigger,  canva did not allow me to directly upload them. instead i used the app to work on the local files and download directly from there. again all worked for all previous videos.i contacted support and this is the outline back and forth:- make sure you have oriented them properly on the editor, download in a different format (canva only shows one format and set off settings for video), try other browser (can't because using local files and app)- uninstall app, clear cache, reinstall app, try again. (followed instructions,  no change)- please give us link to project ( fine,  have link but as the files are local to my machine you won't see them)- please make a screen recording of what your are doing and send us 'raw' original file and 'raw' output file. ( all files too big to send via email so put all in google drive and sent links)- company policy they cannot open any google drive links. please upload to canva and send us the access to the files ( again can't do this, files too big canva will not accept, offered to upload to youtube and give links,  to use wetransfer of any other methods they want- 'we understand that you are unable to upload to canva.hence, may we ask for a screen recording and us other apps to send it as it would be helpful for us to check your issue. anted to get the data to them' ( asked again for them to tell me what app they wanted me to use to get the data to them)- again they said upload the videos to canva (again said that canva would not allow this site to size constraints)- came back with some irrelevant boiler plate message about incompatible file types for images and network connectivity issues- again asked me to upload to canva (still can't! )- told me to cut all of the videos into smaller parts, upload each part and stitch them all back together ( this took close to 3 hours of work, changed permissions and sent links)- permissions need to be changed (i checked, all fine, sent screen grab of all to show, please tell me what one is not right)- one of the google drive files permissions not right ( the ones they said they could not possibly look at sure to company policy)- was informed that engineers are working on fixing the internal issue- 5 days later,  app is fixed. uninstall and reinstall the app. upload your original file and redo. (hours worth of work on a file for a client to be refine,  no chance to use what had already been done)- i asked for a refund- you can't have a refund or terms of service day there can be interruptions in service etc (don't want a refund because of service interruption, terrible customer support)- offered 1 month support subscription (no thank you don't want to use your product)- offered 3 months free subscription to be applied at next billing cycle next dec (no i want a refund)- part refunded rest of this subscription which started dec 30th nothing for earlier post of year,  nothing for all this lost time or having to rub in circles for no outcome,  'as a measure of goodwill.",Updated 7 Apr 2025,1.0

Dropbox,"my experience with dropbox gives me mixed feelings about their tech.canceling plans: canceling a plan is a mess. go to settings > plan > cancel plan, click the button, and… nothing. no error, no feedback, just silence. it’s a rookie ui mistake. i shouldn’t need to email support or wait days to ditch a plan. this alone makes me swear off dropbox subscriptions.photo uploads: you can’t upload photos straight from your phone’s gallery—you’re forced to dig through the dropbox app. adding photos one-by-one is painfully slow, and you can’t drag entire folders to the website. it’s a dealbreaker that pushes me to other apps.file & folder issues: the interface is clunky and buggy. sorting sucks—no option to sort by file type. dragging folders to the site doesn’t work; only individual files upload. creating folders and adding files manually is tedious. moving folders triggers errors like “request failed.” syncing stops if you switch folders mid-upload. it’s a nightmare.account confusion: managing multiple accounts (work vs. personal) is chaos. dropbox’s platform doesn’t clearly separate them, so i mixed up my accounts. linking a new work account was a mess—dropbox kept mislabeling it. deleting an account? good luck. it sends you to a pointless page about linking accounts.data loss risk: deleting files on one device wipes them everywhere—permanently. i deleted folders on a public pc to protect my privacy, and poof, they’re gone from all my devices. no warning, no recovery. that’s unforgivable for cloud storage.website & cloud access: the website is sluggish and half-baked. uploaded photos often don’t show up. i upgraded expecting cloud access, but i’m stuck using my hard drive. the ui flows like molasses.dropbox is barely okay for small, unimportant files like homework (2-3gb max). for photos, business docs, or anything serious, it’s a disaster.",11 Jun 2025,2.0

Zoom,"working with zoom is an incredibly frustrating experience, however i simply haven't been able to find another platform to meet the technical needs for our small business. while the product itself is good and fairly intuitive, the billing practices are abhorrent.self-service is practically impossible. to switch from annual to monthly billing, or vice versa, you have to cancel, wait for everything to disappear, and then you can rejoin. how a tech company doesn't have a basic b2c purchase model is beyond me.we are an events education organization and to have all of our events and webinars ""disappear"" is stressful. yes, they reinstate upon a new purchase, but it still causes downtime on our end where users cannot register for events.we tried leaving zoom and tried other platforms, but sadly there isn't enough competition out there and we had to return - only to once again encounter the same purchase issues which results in hours of my time trying to fix my account with zoom support, filing chargebacks with my bank, and ensuring our events are correct.if i could leave i would, but there are simply no other alternatives with the same features.",5 Jan 2025,1.0
Zoom,"am compelled to share my utterly disappointing experience with zoom phone. recently, my license for 23 seats was canceled without any justification. when i contacted zoom’s support, i was informed that my recent payment had been canceled by my bank. however, i spoke directly with my bank, and they confirmed that they had not canceled anything on my behalf.to add to the absurdity of the situation, i initially paid $210, only to see a mysterious credit of $176.83 appear on my zoom account. if my payment was allegedly canceled, where did this credit come from? the lack of transparency is infuriating.every time i reach out to zoom support, i receive conflicting information. each representative seems unaware of the previous conversations, providing different excuses that do nothing to resolve my issues. it’s as if customer satisfaction is the last thing on their mind.furthermore, when i attempted to buy new licenses, my payment methods were repeatedly rejected, leaving me stranded and frustrated. to top it all off, one support agent accused me of violating some undisclosed policy without ever specifying what that policy is. this vague accusation is not only unprofessional but also indicative of poor customer service.the overall experience with zoom phone has been a complete disaster. this service is a waste of money and time, and it’s clear that customer support is severely lacking. i strongly advise prospective users to think twice before engaging with zoom phone because, based on my experience, you may find yourself dealing with unnecessary headaches and unanswered questions.",3 Jan 2025,1.0
Zoom,"my experience with zoom has been nothing short of frustrating. while the platform itself is functional, their approach to customer retention feels unethical. canceling a subscription is an unnecessarily complex process. the option to cancel is buried in layers of account settings, and even then, you're bombarded with confusing options or forced to contact customer service.to make matters worse, they rely on auto-renewals without clear notifications, leaving you stuck paying for a service you no longer need. when i finally managed to cancel, i still got billed for the next cycle, leading to a tedious dispute process with their billing team. it feels like zoom is more focused on trapping customers than improving their experience.if you’re considering paying for zoom, think twice. the actual service is fine, but their cancellation practices will leave you regretting your decision. do better, zoom.",1 Jan 2025,2.0

ClickUp,"for me the worst part: clickup has a history of unethical business practices, trying to push the workspace owners to pay more and more.their latest move: they've quietly moved some guest members in our (and everyone else's; check reddit) workspace to a new paid seat role ""limited member"". clickup now has an algorithm in place that decides who is allowed to be a guest and who isn't. while we were informed that there is now a new member role available for selection, there was no notification about automatically moving our workspace guests to a paid tier and we certainly did not consent to this. they even moved an account we purely use for testing to a paid tier. there is no way to move back the automatically converted internal guests to the member role. how is this legal?our first issue with them a while back: we were an early adopter and we got a good deal and lifetime discount on our seats. which we were very grateful for and i thought - wow, maybe this company will actually be great to work with - they seem to care about early adopters and i hoped they would be mindful of their early-adopter community.well, i was wrong. less than a year later, they just introduced a new plan (business plus) with some very useful and partially critical features. and while our discount deal was stated to apply to any plan they just claimed that this was a misunderstanding and our discount does not apply to new plans. in the end i just had to give up. trying to get what was promised to us was just too time-consuming.i just can't trust clickup.i would love to be able to love clickup. but how can you trust someone who keeps cheating on you and doesn't change their behavior?unfortunately, for us it's not feasible to move away at the moment. but if you're looking at this, it's not too late for you, and there might be better options out there for you.let's see what hidden or open price increase strategy they'll come up with next.(to be fair, i want to mention that at least on the existing plan they've stuck to their promise of grandfathered pricing per seat - so far.)as soon as you've moved to the platform it's hard to move away. in business terms they're bulding a big moat and try to use this to squeeze as much money out of their smb customers, hiding behind empty phrases such as ""industry standard"" and ""enhancing productivity and collaboration"". honestly, i feel bad for clickup's support staff, having to justify bs company policies over and over again. i wouldn't last a day in this job.basically, by committing to clickup, you're committing to untrustworthy behavior and cost increases year after year.",11 Jan 2025,1.0
ClickUp,"i have been using clickup for years for both work and personal information. on the personal side, there have been many times where i have not accessed it frequently, but used it to document gifts, anniversaries, and travel information for reference. apparently at the beginning of 2024, something changed in their active policy. because i did not log in for 90 days, they sent an email that my data would be archived and then deleted. they only sent two emails (both of which went to my promotions tab in google and were missed because of the tendency of that to be junk and the fact that i was traveling out of the country and not monitoring my email closely) and then sent nothing else. i lost all of my data that cannot be restored. for a company that has a ""free forever"" plan and is meant to store and archive data, i think that a 180 day window is ridiculous and that their communication was terrible around this considering i would get multiple emails a week at times around their feature updates and bug fixes. i do not recommend clickup because of this and will be finding a new platform or way to track both my work and personal information.",4 Jan 2025,1.0

ClickUp,"reporting bugs is very hard; the system for reporting is absolutely unfriendly and feels like it's designed for the company's employees rather than the users. so, i'll do it here because it's the first thing that came to my mind after i tried to report a bug in their way.there are mainly two things that make me rage every single time:- there's no normal ctrl+z (undo) implementation anywhere. almost wherever you text, it's a huge mess. it undoes things, but not what you want. for example, you add a screenshot and you can't use undo to delete it; instead, it deletes something else that has nothing to do with what you did just now or even recently. it's baffling and makes the experience super uncomfortable.- the task drafting system is terrible. just imagine yourself writing a big task and suddenly closing the brower's window – that's it, you lost it forever. if you didn't press on the space outside of the modal window or properly close the window itself, there's no way to save what you just wrote.these are just two of the things that i wanted to say. i really hope the company will see this and do something about it. i enjoy using clickup overall, but the company definitely needs to put more effort into making it easy for users to share their feedback. the product is comprehensive and it has bugs like every other, but it seems like they either do not want to receive feedback, or they expect that people will put in as much effort as it takes right now",9 Aug 2024,2.0

ClickUp,"while i would prefer not to resort to negativity, it's only fair to share my genuine and honest experience with others who might be considering using this service. the primary issue i've experienced pertains to their billing practices. unbeknownst to me, i was billed for two consecutive years, totaling $450, during which time my account was dormant.it seems there's a lack of transparency when it comes to their auto-renewal system, as i was neither informed about nor consented to these charges. the fact that the account, including its members, were inactive during this period didn't seem to impact their decision to bill me.upon realizing this, i reached out to their customer service, hoping for some understanding and a fair resolution. regrettably, this wasn't the case. despite my efforts to explain the situation, the service team offered no assistance or empathy, firmly stating that my subscription had not been canceled by their system, hence the charges.this experience left me feeling quite frustrated. it's one thing to have a policy, but a company's ability to understand and reasonably accommodate their customers' unique circumstances is, in my opinion, the true testament of their customer service. sadly, in this case, they fell significantly short.i wish i could offer a more positive review but, under these circumstances, i feel it's important to caution potential users about this potential pitfall. please ensure you're aware of their auto-renewal policy and monitor your billing closely.",19 Jul 2023,1.0

(yeah, even trustpilot won't let me use the word) and thanks to your ad, my kid now keeps saying it too.really?it actually shows why they have to go down this route, because if they showed their own product it would need to be very heavily edited as to hide all the bugs. there are a lot of bugs.probably a nice tools for teams of 20 -30. more than that and you need to look elsewhere.thankfully our company is ditching them for another tool... yeah you guessed right.",22 Sept 2021,1.0

ClickUp,"really thrilled to see the high rating for clickup.  definitely worth it.i started freelancing mid-last-year, and am a mess keeping things straight for myself.  i explored a number (6? 7?) different project management apps and clickup caught my attention with its look, style, and how things are organized.i immediately started populating it with my information and was soon tracking numerous projects across several industries.  there is *soooo* much to this app that it takes time to learn it all (and i haven't yet).  start with the simple and obvious, and learn as you go.  there is soooo much task and project detail it can capture.  it's amazing.i have a sense that, as a single-member operation, that i'm only using about 40% of its max potential.  while it seems to have robust collaborative features, those aren't something i'm routinely involved with, so can't review them very well.  hopefully, others have.task management is ""list-like"", but there are so many other ways to view work/lists/projects - kanban, ""card"", gantt, calendar, mind maps...  the list (literally) goes on.all tasks are summarized at a number of levels ""up the chain"" to give you both overall, summary views as well as granular view deeper than you would probably want to go.  i could write all night about the features in clickup - there are so many features (large and small) to get your management down quickly and easily.impressively, updates come out weekly (? - more often?).  they are *constantly* updating the app - fixing issues, plugging in new features, making things smoother.  i can't wait, each week, to see that email come through about the new release/update, and seeing what it can do now.i haven't had to use support often (kudos!), but when i have, they've been responsive and knowledgeable - able to answer my questions completely.they have a library of videos for using the software in general as well as configuring it for the industry you're working with/in.  i've run through a *bunch* of these and they are well put together and informative.i started with the free version, which worked well, but as i needed to capture more and more, i shifted to the smallest paid plan they offer.  the price (annual) is amazing for an app like this and all it contains and can do.  well worth the price.so, i'll close with... if you want to keep yourself well organized across many, many industries/projects/tasks, without breaking the bank - move to clickup!  it's very obvious they invest in constant improvement and move the software forward and upward.  a great product.",11 Aug 2021,5.0

Hubspot,"hubspot starter hub is now a totally useless product. you need their expensive pro at 1,000usd/month for even the most basic stuff.for example, service hub starter can't automatically create a ticket when an email is received in our helpdesk mailbox. you have to manually change incoming emails (conversations) into tickets, assign, and follow-up. no auto-replies or any other basic form of automation despite what they make it sound like (a complete solution) when you read about the starter hub on their website. why use a crm if nothing can be automated?then they also scammed us in paying an extra month of starter licenses because you can't delete accounts or payment methods, only cancel auto-renewal. cancelled well in advance but it seems a few days later they turned it on again and invoiced me again end of the month. we think because one of our test users accidentally logged in, but keeping detailed track of everything now, and will update here if they do that again.in conclusion, the once amazing hubspot has turned into a greedy company with an enterprise-only product. there are much better and more affordable crm solutions out there.",2 Mar 2025,2.0

Hubspot,"aggressive sales tactics and an overpriced, underwhelming productwe initially started with hubspot's free version, and that's when their aggressive sales tactics began.  the constant calls and emails were incredibly intrusive and bordered on harassment.  despite this, they convinced us that their software could handle our specific need for managing product variants and combinations within their quoting functionality.however, we were unable to test this crucial feature without upgrading to a paid plan.  after countless calls and emails detailing our requirements, we finally relented, trusting that hubspot could deliver on their promises.to our dismay, the system couldn't handle our needs, rendering it essentially useless for our business.  not only is hubspot the most expensive crm on the market, but it also has the worst interface – cluttered, confusing, and incredibly user-unfriendly. we might have overlooked these shortcomings if the software had actually met our core requirements.since hubspot failed in this regard, we were forced to integrate a third-party system (at an additional cost) just to send quotes, making the entire process even more cumbersome and time-consuming.the final straw?  during the whirlwind of calls and emails, we were somehow tricked into signing a 12-month contract that we can't get out of. this is the most unethical business practice i've encountered in my 20 years in the it industry.i strongly advise anyone considering hubspot to steer clear. they mislead you with false promises about their product, just to lock you into an inescapable contract.their product is outrageously overpriced and doesn't offer anything that countless other crms can't provide at a fraction of the cost, without the shady contract terms.avoid hubspot and their unethical bait-and-switch tactics at all costs.",30 Dec 2024,1.0

Hubspot,"i recently had an interaction with hubspot that left me with a bitter taste about their customer service and flexibility. here's my story.when i purchased a subscription, i trusted the process and agreed to their terms, thinking i'd found a platform that could support my business needs. unfortunately, my circumstances changed, and i realized the subscription wasn't working out as expected. naturally, i reached out to their team to explore options for an early cancellation or at least downgrading the service.enter amna muratagic, a representative from hubspot. amna's response was swift and professional, but the message was clear: ""no early cancellations, no downgrades, no exceptions."" she explained that i had agreed to a legally binding contract and pointed out the terms i had accepted at the time of purchase.while i appreciate her clarity and polite tone, the lack of flexibility left me frustrated. life and business are unpredictable, and i hoped a company of hubspot's caliber would understand this. instead, i was met with rigid policies and no room for negotiation. amna kindly offered to help me ""make the most of my subscription,"" but it felt like a band-aid on a deeper issue.what disappointed me most was the absence of creative solutions. no prorated refund, no credits for future use, no alternative plans—just a firm reiteration of the contract i was locked into. i felt more like a transaction than a valued customer.this experience taught me a hard lesson about reading the fine print and understanding what kind of company you're partnering with. hubspot's tools might be powerful, but their approach to customer relationships leaves much to be desired.if you're considering a subscription with hubspot, be absolutely sure you're committed to the full term. because once you’re in, there’s no way out—even if your needs change.i hope hubspot reconsiders its policies to better support customers facing unforeseen circumstances. until then, i can't say i’d recommend them to others.",16 Nov 2024,1.0

Hubspot,"when i returned to india after years of selling it services to enterprises in the us, i was determined to reignite my entrepreneurial spirit. in 2007, i launched iretail 1.0, an end-to-end ecommerce solution that helped businesses maximize retail sales and customer retention. determined to further revolutionize the afl (apparel, footwear, and luxury fashion retail and e-commerce) sector, i embarked on iretail 2.0 with maplesage.initially following the traditional sales approach of cold calling and mass emails, i quickly realized this was failing to yield results. despite understanding our target accounts' pain points, we struggled to connect and align our messaging effectively. this experience taught me that sales and marketing efforts must be harmonized, and we need to provide valuable content to genuinely engage our audience.that's when i discovered hubspot's transformative inbound marketing methodology of attract, engage, convert, and delight (now evolved into the flywheel model). impressed by this customer-centric approach, i decided to partner with hubspot after extensively evaluating alternatives like mailchimp, activecampaign, marketo, and sharpspring. i chose hubspot for its rich content offerings and dedicated learning resources through hubspot academy.the pivotal moment came with openai's gpt release in november 2022. recognizing the synergies, we integrated gpt with hubspot by building an rag plugin synchronized with aws lambda, appsync, amplify graphql, and next.js. serendipitously, the hubspot team was simultaneously developing groundbreaking ai features like chatspot.ai, showcasing their unwavering commitment to evolving with customer needs.at maplesage, our journey began in new delhi, where a passion for technology and apparel took root. this passion blossomed in nyc's fashion innovation scene, co-founding brands like michael h jeans, k denim, and killer jeans co. by 2019, we emerged as a hubspot & aws-certified agency, spearheading digital branding and b2b services.today, maplesage is revolutionizing the fashion and luxury industries by leveraging hubspot, bigcommerce, shopify, and aws to create an ai-driven platform. we empower brands with immersive digital showrooms, streamlined wholesale ordering, advanced order management, and real-time analytics. with comprehensive erp integrations and global support, we help brands expand their reach, drive conversions, and stay ahead of the competition.hubspot's innovative features like ai-powered content generation, seo tools, advanced workflows, custom objects, and comprehensive commerce functionalities have been game-changers. with custom objects, react integration, aws eventbridge, and seamless connectivity with platforms like shopify and bigcommerce, hubspot offers a robust solution tailored to the afl sector.sustainability is ingrained in our operations at maplesage. through hubspot, we align brands with conscious consumers' values, reducing environmental footprints and enhancing brand reputation. our clients have experienced significant increases in lead generation and online sales, underscoring the effectiveness of our hubspot-powered approach.in a world where salesforce reigns as the crm giant, hubspot emerges as the innovative 'mac' of its domain, offering unmatched value and forward-thinking capabilities. hubspot has been the catalyst for transforming my business from software chaos to operational harmony, and i wholeheartedly recommend their platform to any entrepreneur seeking a future-proof, customer-centric solution.",24 May 2024,5.0

Notion,"this is my first-ever review, but notion’s support was so bad that i had to write it. i canceled my paid subscription, yet out of nowhere, i was charged 3.5 times more than usual. their support claimed it was because i added a user — which i never did. when i asked for a refund, they refused at first. only after insisting did they offer me a laughable $12, while they basically stole around $60 from me. i repeatedly asked to speak with a supervisor, and they consistently ignored me. it was only when i involved their legal department and head of finance that i finally got reimbursed.i still have a freemium account, but after this ugly experience, i don’t enjoy using it at all. avoid notion!",29 Mar 2025,1.0
Notion,"i’m writing this review to warn others about notion’s deceptive billing practices, inaccessible customer service, and complete lack of accountability. what started as a simple subscription downgrade request turned into a months-long nightmare that left me financially strained and deeply frustrated. if you’re considering notion, think twice—their app might be sleek, but their customer service is a disaster.here’s what happened: i signed up for notion’s premium plan but quickly realized the app didn’t offer the features i needed. i hadn’t used it in over two months, so on march 13, 2025, i emailed their support team to downgrade my account to the free plan, as their emails had stated i’d lose premium access if payment failed. i was fine with that—i just wanted out of the subscription. instead of honoring my request, notion kept trying to charge me. on march 18, 2025, the second funds hit my account, they deducted the payment—despite my clear instructions to downgrade.i immediately requested a refund, explaining that i’m unemployed and needed the money for a specialist medical appointment that day. because of notion’s actions, i had to borrow money from my son to cover the cost, adding stress to an already difficult situation. their response? a canned email from “the representative” (who, by the way, is just a campus ambassador, not even a proper support rep—more on that later), citing a 3-day refund window and refusing to help. the invoice they charged me for was issued on february 22, 2025, but i’d already requested a downgrade on march 13, well before the payment was taken. they ignored that completely.it gets worse. notion’s emails are contradictory and misleading. i have a screenshot of an email stating it was their “last attempt” to process payment, but the representative later claimed they can retry up to 8 times over a month—a direct contradiction. he also mentioned an unpaid invoice from january 22, 2025, but i’ve searched my inbox, spam, and trash—there’s no such invoice. either they never sent it, or they’re making it up to justify taking my money. when i called them out on this, they went silent.their downgrade process is a joke. they told me to downgrade via the web app (settings > billing > change plan), but i only have mobile access and told them so multiple times. here’s the kicker: i could delete my account on mobile with no issue, but downgrading? impossible with their instructions. they set me up to fail and then blamed me for it.i escalated my complaint, demanding a refund and for someone senior to step in. the person responding, who i later found out on linkedin is just a campus ambassador (basically a student rep for marketing, not support), refused to escalate. he kept hiding behind “policy,” even though i hadn’t used the app in months and had clearly requested a downgrade. i gave them a 24-hour deadline to respond—three days ago. they’ve gone completely silent, which shows how little they care about their customers.notion’s behavior is predatory and unethical. they ignored my downgrade request, took money i couldn’t afford to lose, and left me to deal with the consequences. i’m now pursuing a formal complaint with the department of fair trading in australia (where notion has an office in sydney) and considering the federal trade commission in the us (their hq is in san francisco). i’ll also be sharing this experience on every platform i can to warn others. notion might have a shiny app, but their customer service is a black hole—don’t trust them with your money.if you’re thinking of using notion, beware: their billing practices are deceptive, their support is inaccessible, and they’ll leave you high and dry when things go wrong. save yourself the headache and look elsewhere.",24 Mar 2025,1.0

Notion,"whilst we originally had very high hopes for this product, and used it well professionally and personally for nearly two years, it has declined rapidly into a platform that force-feeds you the usage of a really lacklustre ai, that then offer a free platform that's seemingly purposely built to bait you into paying by unexpectedly locking all of your data in read-only until you do.the ai features have been added to more and more parts of the ui over time, to the point where it was put in where other ui elements used to be, resulting in frequent accidental clicks due to muscle memory. this then immediately starts the ai engaging with you, which a) means your data is now shared with it, and b) you're dragged off what you were doing, for a most likely incorrect answer. they also removed the option to disable the ai from the free and even paid plans, for some odd reason, and now you have to jump through hoops with their support platform.as for the free plan. it is free for collaborative use as long as you use less than 1000 'blocks', however, as of recently;they removed the ability to tell how many blocks are used - seemingly to bait people into using them and ending up in this stalemate position.they allow people to delete items to free up blocks, but only until they hit this (newly invisible) quota, then they lock their data read-only until you pay.they give no credit to any user in this situation also having paid workspaces and wanting to keep different sets of data separated. eg we pay hundreds per year for my wife and i to have one workspace with unlimited, but we use that for our professional projects, so used a free one for our house activities like tasks and shopping lists. same users, just a different workspace.they implemented an auto-delete feature for trashed items where the ui says old items will be deleted, but items trashed before that date actually don't get deleted.they don't have a 'empty trash' button, so users have to painstakingly manually remove things one by one if they want any hope of staying on the 'free' tier at all.the ui shows the trash as empty once you remove enough items, another baiting tactic, so you may think that you've cleared the trash and freed up blocks (since now you cannot check), however, if you close and re-open notion you'll find the trash is full again!they seemingly remove the warning about approaching the block limit, likely related to not showing it any more, so people don't know when to start paying more attention.be warned!",6 Nov 2024,1.0

(i can guess why there's a ticket backlog with how confusing the purchase process is).it's now been a full work week, and despite multiple follow ups there's been no response from this finance team.   yes, it's only been a week, but 1) $96 is a lot of money for some of us to be out for any amount of time when we didn't budget for it,  2) it's ridiculous that the matter of a simple refund needs to be ""escalated"" to a finance team at all - especially when they expound upon their ""no hassle"" refund policy on their own website.  if they were actually trying to make it no hassle, they'd empower their customer service reps to issue refunds for anything that clearly falls within their stated policies.  there's nothing to review here!  i requested a refund within minutes of purchase, and their policy says i'll be issued a refund if requested within 30 days!, and 3) it's a joke that a cutting edge tech company who boasts about their ai capabilities requires human review for this at all!   there should be a button on the billing page directly next to the charge where customer's can file a refund request.  the data verification (which basically amounts to ""is the purchase date within 30 days of the refund request? y/n"") should be instantaneous.one last thing.  if you've got multiple work spaces on a single account, you should be aware that even if you did intend to pay $96 for their cruddy ai, it will only work within the workspace you're in when you purchase it.  there's absolutely no disclaimer to this effect, and this is different from any other app i've used where you can partition your use cases (here it's work vs personal).  i purchased this within my personal work space, which i hardly use, but would have to pay another $96 if i wanted to use it in my professional workspace.   i'm now realizing that this is a larger infrastructure problem where it's impossible to tell which settings are applied to you're account, and which ones are specific to individual workspaces.i've already had mounting privacy concerns about using notion (who's business model is basically to give away the main product and generate revenue from selling your private data), and this lack of concern for customers just tipped me over to deleting the app.  i'm glad i never built it out as much as i wanted to.buyer beware!",13 Jul 2024,1.0

Notion,"be careful with notion and its cancellation policy.- if you bought a useless ai module and after some time you want to cancel it, you will be refused and the money will not be returned and will not be credited for another product;- if you cancel a certain number of users in an annual subscription, you receive credits for the next year. any requests for a refund will not work;- the support service is misleading, first confirms the possibility of changing the issued invoice, and after a week of deliberation says that it is impossible to change the invoice. if you have your own business, then you understand perfectly well that any invoice can be changed, refunded, and so on;- if you want to try notion, never choose an annual plan, only a monthly one, otherwise, you will not be able to change anything, and you will be charged the maximum amount of money;",16 May 2024,1.0

Notion,"look, if i could give it 6 stars i would, if only for how much value it is even on the free plan. this tool is for those who like to tinker around and create their own systems for organizing and planning their personal life and business-related matters. the app itself is very robust with an amazing customization potential. it's accessible on all your devices - you can write something on the pc, pull out your phone and it's immediately there. the way it allows you to very easily embed images, links, toggles, bullet points and other good stuff is amazing! love it. there are some things that the app lacks, but they're minor things, that pretty much no other app has either, so i really have nothing to complain about, really. i fell in love with this thing the moment i saw what it can do, after the initial setup.i'm running it on a free plan right now, but i am absolutely planning to use it for managing my business as soon as i hire employees. and i'll feel great about paying for it, because honestly, notion blows away all competition in terms of functionality and how consistently it manages to work (i'd been more frustrated using google's own productivity tools than i have using notion).so to sum up, if you're a tinkerer and planning maniac who likes to write a lot of stuff down and sort it into boxes, shelves and archives; if you like to create your own systems and customize them a lot; if you want to create a second brain for yourself to keep organized and productive; notion is for you.notion is not for you, if you expect an out-of-the-box solution to all of your problems and you don't like spending much time setting up productivity systems or you aren't good at it. that being said, thomas frank's templates are great and they're free to use. and i'm sure there are many others as well shared by other people in the community.",3 Apr 2022,5.0

Salesforce,"i wish i had read these reviews before going into business with these thieves!!my experience with salesforce has been a horrendous ordeal from start to finish. it all began with the sales agent who was overly persistent and pushy. it wasn't until after everything was finalized that i realized he had blatantly lied about the terms of our contract.as a small business with only 10 employees, we were unsure if we needed 4 accounts/licenses. however, the sales agent assured us that in order to secure a discount deal, we would need the four licenses, with the option to remove them later if unnecessary. he claimed it would be easier to adjust the number of licenses rather than purchasing additional ones later on. this, however, turned out to be a blatant falsehood.we encountered continuous issues trying to integrate our sales system with salesforce's, facing compatibility problems at every turn. when we requested to have the unnecessary licenses removed, they refused and insisted that we were bound by the terms of the contract for the entire year.despite numerous attempts to contact them via email, phone calls, and even filing a complaint against the sales agent with his manager for unethical behavior, we were simply redirected to their 'legal' department. instead of addressing our concerns, they relentlessly demanded payment to fulfill the contract. in the end, we had to involve our bank and provide evidence that their system was incompatible with ours in order to secure a refund for their failure to deliver the promised service.their shady business practices are nothing short of a scam, preying on hardworking businesses for profit. my advice to others is to steer clear of salesforce at all costs. it was a year-long nightmare that i deeply regret enduring.",9 Sept 2024,1.0

Salesforce,"salesforce is one of the worst contact management softwares i have ever used in my 15 years as a salesperson. contact management and time management are the two most important aspects of your day when running your practice and i still can't believe how bad salesforce is at this after using the platform for so many months now. i have given it a fair chance and my expectations were reasonably high based on what i was told it would be like but they have grossly over promised and severly underdelivered. i honestly don't know how people use it for effective contact management and relationship building with clients and customers. it is clunkly, non intuitive, simple tasks take way too many clicks and time, it's very slow, and i mean very slow to load compared to other platforms i have used and for what we should expect for our internet speed and just the expectations of technology today. not to mention the expectations set by sf. it's not that hard to learn as i heard from some reviews in the beginning. i think some people get feedback mixed up with learning curve and just horrible processes. anyone who is in sales knows how important contact tracking and activity tracking are. i love to track for my business and i am a very good at taking care of clients because of my attention to details. with sf, it takes many more clicks and actions for the most basic logging of activities. it makes no sense, not even from a managerial level as our compliance team has complained about how to best monitor activities with the way the system requires us to enter info. think about it like this: your a bakery chef and someone comes to you and says they are going to build you a custom kitchen, the best custom kitchen that will help you cook and serve customers. they build the kitchen and stick the cooling racks for the baked goods on the opposite side of the kitchen from the ovens, not next to them, as far away as possible. you ask them to update it, and they seemingly can't. it truly feels like whoever developed the software has very little to no experience in sales or any position that requires relationship management. i have asked a number of peers in my industry and in other industries about their experience with sf and every single person i have talked to hates it and has similiar feedback to me even though they have their own customised versions. from my experiences, you would have to have some really terrible crm software for salesforce to be an improvement.",25 Jun 2024,1.0

Salesforce,"my company uses salesforce because its software we know. however, now that we’ve had about 4 months of service with them, we’re rethinking our commitment.first, the software is insanely expensive and the basic out of the box functionality is not reliable. (salesforce, check my trouble tickets)we have had to employ a third party expert to get in and make changes to things like admin vs general user permissions- you know- because why would we want a general user to be able to delete other people’s records?when the expert then says “hmm… this is odd, the changes i’ve made aren’t working. i’ll have to submit a trouble ticket”, i am now paying the person to get your support people online to tell him it’s a glitch on their end and nothing he can fix. please stand by and we’ll flip switches on our end… i still have to pay that person for salesforce’s issues. so for that, i’m quite irritated that the cost isn’t the cost. i have to pay a professional because i don’t know if i’m doing it wrong or if salesforce just isn’t working today.functionality issues aside, the billing department is useless. “we would have been able to accommodate your requests if you had reached out to us prior to xyz date.”my reply: i have forwarded you two examples of when i reached out prior to xyz date and received no response.”(insert salesforce mea culpa here)salesforce also doesn’t tell you that they’ll discuss your account information with anyone they think they should. but fear not! the information they provide you won’t be accurate anyway- so it really doesn’t matter.does this inaccurate and unauthorized information exchange matter to them? no!you’ll get a reply that you should know better. but not an actual apology for their misinformation or mishandling of information.it doesn’t matter if this issue causes a panic, costs money on our end, or eats up our own valuable time. everything is the customer’s fault.save money and time by going elsewhere. at this juncture, i think we’ll have our own crm built because in the long run, it will save us money and hassle.",4 May 2024,1.0

Salesforce,"salesforce has been in use at the last 3 companies i've worked for. it has been deficient in all three cases.as an end-user, my main issue is the general slowness. followed closely by poor ux. users are typically required to click too many dropdowns & buttons to achieve simple tasks. they are expected to change context frequently and copy/paste data from one place to another. asking the admin to add another field guarantees it will be placed in a suboptimal location and require lots of scrolling & clicks to manipulate - or worse, the admin won't know how to add a field, so they'll simply tell users to just write that data in plain text in a generic notes textbox.sure, this can all be streamlined with the help of an experienced salesforce admin. or a consultant. but businesses don't want to spend that kind of money, so users are forced to use a shambolic system that's not fit for purpose.skip this paragraph if you're not a javascript dev: i personally wrote many lines of javascript in tampermonkey scripts, to paper over the cracks and give users a good experience. until the salesforce devs changed the frontend code to make it harder to hack. they even had some code that intercepted any errors in my code and sent the data straight to their logs, instead of logging the errors to the browser console. dirty, dirty, dirty. the entire system is purposely obfuscated so that people can't easily write their own code to interact with it - the aim is to get us to pay more money for integrations or consultants.some unscrupulous salesforce or third party reps have been pushing salesforce to small charities recently. it's clearly not what these organizations can use or afford. i'm on the periphery of a charity who got sold a dud salesforce setup. they were promised the earth. and now that it doesn't perform as expected, the seller is charging them to add these features after the fact. it is the sunk-cost fallacy writ large.salesforce is a multi-level marketing scheme. nobody likes it, and its efficacy is unproven, yet it somehow keeps getting sold to unwitting companies and charities. you can't get the most out of it (or anything out of it, really) without paying someone at a higher level of the pyramid. i hope the whole thing falls apart soon and never recovers.you can tell it was created by salespeople, for salespeople - they are only interested in making money selling this product by whatever means necessary. no time has been spent making it useful or even usable.i've been waiting years for an outlet for all this. thank you trustpilot, and the other people who have reviewed salesforce here. it's been a while since i read so much truth in one place.",6 Sept 2023,1.0

Salesforce,"can't ever log in. whatever i try, i can never log in to the service. they also insist on referring to their app using titles that are not how they are named on your phone. the authenticator app is called authenticator, not salesforce.

Salesforce,"we are a sme and bought tableau from salesforce. we have used this with problems throughout the 2 years.while the software itself is good, the customer service and support is absolutely terrible. more than four times, we had our access cut off for no explanation. they would create excuses that we had not logged the complaint through the customer portal when it was an issue to access the portal in the first place so it was impossible. they chose to ignore this and grudgingly accepted to communicate via email for which they remained rude and unhelpful. a mixture of 5 salesforce staff were copied but only 1 was replying from india. the rest were based in dubai, indonesia and sydney; why we didn't get the australian representative, we don't know! it took 5 months after our initial complaint for them to finally renew our account. about 3 months in, our licence was ceased even though we had paid for 1 year. they gave no explanation other than a technical error and then made some excuse that we had to send a formal letterhead to request for it to be renewed again. this was quite the most ridiculous and unhelpful support we have ever faced in a business environment. we are certainly warning our business partners to avoid salesforce in the future.",15 Jun 2023,1.0

Salesforce,"thanks salesforce for charging me a fortune for your crm to provide useless customer care and support!! you have locked my account as my bank card had expired. the frustrating part is you then provide a wrong number on my account screen to sort this out. i then search a telephone number on the web to be confronted when i ring  with an automated message which just creates a case number and no one calls back . i then speak to technical support who tell me you have  no customer service department to talk to anyone  and that i need to speak to my account director who i need to email and won’t give me  a telephone number for me to contact . i ask him to contact him for me , he is  not allowed and he also not allowed to email him for me !finally, my account director reads my email who calls me to take my payment. now at this stage you would think my account would be switched on instantly , but no, this is not the case ! he now has to raise a case id, as he too can’t speak to anyone internally and   only able by email !   he also can’t tell how long this will take, but did said normally it could  be days, but he raised it as an  urgent case, so he hopes it may be today but can’t promise!! fingers crossed eh !!so we are  now 4 hours later and neither me or my employees can use my system to carry out our daily work !  we can’t work without this system as it holds all our account information. what if i had 100 employees who couldn’t work!!   time is  wasted money!!! this should have been a 2-minute job!in fact the same situation  happened to a different company who handle my email system. i literally clicked on a button, entered my card details and my account was switched back on in seconds. you would think an establishment like salesforce would  have a set up the same, but no, they have to make it so complicated and to make it worse no one for you to speak to resolve quickly and efficientlyi’ve gone to write a  review on @salesforceuk  and i’ve seen all the terrible reviews on how bad your service is !  and yep you haven’t even got the decency to reply to these customers on their online complaints ( says it all really! )well you used to be  the main crm , you certainly charge the most ! but the way you  have set your infrastructure up to look after your customer is so poor, that your customers are  leaving, including myself !why do these big companies take your money , but you can’t speak to a human is beyond me, to resolve situations quickly and efficiently.if you want a crm, my advice is  don’t go to salesforce, i thought i was paying high rates for a good service , this is not the case.  don’t be fooled by the ploy you pay for what you get, as i would give zero stars if i  could .",9 May 2023,1.0
Salesforce,"like many below , if zero stars was an option it would be that. i have had a very similar experience to many others but here in australia. salesforce actively hunted me down due to a staff person being employed there who i had previously worked with. at the time we were spending 20k a month aud on marketing and were looking for an extra 5-10% roas from our decent spend in a growing market during covid. salesforce took this request and turned around promising insane roas increases of 100% which were taken with a grain of salt, all i wanted was small growth on my spend. they convinced their recent acquisition of marketing cloud  , a machine learning marketing platform promising cutting edge abilities to curate a customer eco-system that grew and learned as it operated in the background. claims were made that companies like netflix and other huge companies used the platform and we able to customise their users experience based on the machine learning. these claims remain unsubstantiated and unproven despite multiple requests. salesforce marketing cloud claims to be a 'out of the box' solution meaning that huge amounts of funds were required to set the tool up. promises were made to assist with the transition and support was supposedly everywhere. as soon as the tool was installed the support disappeared almost immediately. we re-aligned funds that were already being spent to the tune of 11k aud a month with excitement that we could achieve a higher roas as promised. we were told the machine needed months to learn and grow so we waited . then the rot set in. our sales online began to unexplainably decrease at an alarming rate. we did some investigating and brought in some it experts. what we discovered once inside the platform was that it was nearly impossible to see what was going on within the 'machine' and alarmingly we had no access to the customer information being brought in via cookies to the tool. all we could see was a bunch of pre existing customers where being circulated around and around the system often sent the same repeated email and becoming annoyed by this. the main attraction to the product was the customisation being advertised by salesforce essentially suggesting that each customer could be provided with a different experience on our website and via email via automation derived from cookie information. essentially a drummer got delivered drum info, a guitarist got guitar info. to this day we have not seen this ability within the tool, had any proof of its existence and after repeated requests for assistance and question's we essentially started being ignored.the product does not work, it is essentially a marketing tool designed only to benefit salesforce by gathering data that only they benefit from and that their customers pay for. in the 18 months since signing on to salesforce there are multiple products and companies offering similar,  if not more advanced technological options at fractions of the cost.well after all this we asked 12 months in to sever our contract as we were showing proof that our business had suffered greatly due to salesforce's inability to deliver on its promises. we had to make moves quickly as by this point in time we had invested 180k in the product, roughly 2 % of our turnover at the time. salesforce began by stating that they would assist and began investigating whether we could sever our contract after 12 months . there was positivity and some suggestion that previous customers had been let out of their contracts due to the product not working. then radio silence.they took 4 months to reply to an email at which point we went to the accc and small business ombudsmen. they then refused mediation and took another 4 months to respond to an additional email request .i would be very interested based on what i've read if anyone would be interested in initiating a class action against salesforce so that more business owners don't have to go through this. i can be contacted at on facebook, username aursino, if anyone would like more information or is interested in looking at a class action.",Updated 10 May 2023,1.0
Salesforce,"it’s 1star as you can’t select zero.in 2021 as a small business, it was clear that our desk based system wasn’t working especially with more remote working post pandemic. so decided to invest in the future and purchased sakesforce.  we were pushed for the 5 year package, based on “better pricing” … now i know why that was.they introduced us to some consultants and i told them many times that i needed our history porting over and new templates being set up.  neither of these happened. after firing these consultants and using another set, with much the same experience.  claims that “yes that won’t be a problem” we’re clearly there for the gullible … which appears to include me.frustrated and with a significant impact on our business we moved to zohoone.now i’m being chased to pay all the costs for the full 5 years.  i have some issues with paying a penny, but accept our year “usage” … we could never actually use the system, hence the quotation marks.  so now we are facing a £50k bill … for nothing!!!i can see the fine print, saying it is non-cancellable.but how can this be an acceptable contract?  to me it feels like legalised extortion, a clear example of where the market does work, if left unchecked.i’m really interested if anyone is planning a class action suit, and i’m sure they are working on divide and conquer and as companies we don’t have the same protections of consumers, though i don’t understand why this is.run away from this software and evil organisation",6 May 2023,1.0

Salesforce,"we signed up with salesforce under the premise they would help us tighten up our process and organization. the price point was high but the benefit seemed well worth it. after pulling the trigger and paying for the full year upfront, the communication dropped off. we received access to a complicated system and after 2+ weeks of trying to get in contact with someone who could guide us, we had an appointment with develops and our rep. the meeting was one where almost no value was provided and it was clear the developers were not interested in helping develop something to help grow our business. we pushed through it and another 2 weeks later, had a follow up meeting. they presented a plan that was ""tailored"" to our business but it was a cookie cutter template that didn't even hit the hot buttons we had discussed during our initial call. the price for them to implement this template was over $10,000 and we had already invested $2,000. i decided this wasn't a good fit for our business and asked them to cancel our subscription. i never received confirmation of the cancellation and just expected them to turn it off so it wouldn't renew after a year.over the last few weeks, i have been receiving emails from their system telling me we were up for automatic renewal in march. i have reached out to our rep multiple times. the second time, she cc'd the renewals manager on the email asking for assistance. after two more follow up messages, i received this response: ""i already contacted lisa about this and we are working internally on it! i will keep you posted but we have everything that we need from you at this point."" but i am still receiving renewal emails.in my experience, our rep was inexperienced, unhelpful, unable to hear what the client is asking for and checked out the moment we decided to move in another direction. perhaps a much larger client would have a better experience, but we will not be sharing any positive feedback within the communities we are involved in about salesforce.",6 Jan 2023,1.0

Shopify,"shopify as a platform may work well for many, but my main concern lies with their lack of accountability when it comes to unscrupulous merchants. there seems to be little to no protection for customers, especially when it comes to managing payments or subscriptions.for instance, i accidentally ended up with a subscription to drift.co, a site that didn’t make it at all clear it was using shopify. i only realised it was a shopify-powered store after receiving the order confirmation. when i tried to remove my payment method, the drift.co site stated that billing was “managed by shopify”. however, when i attempted to log into shopify, it turned out i didn’t even have an account with them – at least not one they recognised. even when i set up an account using the same email i used with drift.co, none of my orders or payment information appeared.this raises serious questions. it feels as though shopify is turning a blind eye to what these third-party merchants are doing, and in doing so, is indirectly enabling them. customers are left with no clear route to cancel, manage or even view their transactions.at the very least, this needs proper investigation. as it stands, it appears shopify and certain vendors are supporting each other in quietly draining small amounts from customers—charges which may seem minor individually, but can collectively amount to a significant sum over time.",2 days ago,1.0

Shopify,"i have been a shopify customer since february 18, 2024. on march 14th my store/brand was hacked. i had invested over $1000 into my store i believed i had lost everything. on march 17th i reported it stolen to shopify. they from that day forward allowed me to believe it had been hacked all over again for months and months and months. reason i believed this is bc when my account was recovered in the first place i automatically decided to change the email on the account so that the hack couldn’t do any else to my store. in the midst of changing the email on my account while waiting for email validation my entire account disappeared. i assumed it was hacked again but in that’s when shopify actually froze/stole my account. it’s been a huge coverup every time i try to recover my account from march 17-may 30th everyone continued to make me believe my account was still hacked. anyway finally one rep told me the truth and i was able to make big leaps forward. i contacted the agentsagain again my account was escalated i was able to at least try to tell account security their horrible mistake but i can’t. i finally passed the identity verification after having to prove my own identity not once but 4 times and for the simple fact that’s a photo of myself on my store front page. i sent them 2-3 photos of myself holding my drivers license that right there is proof not to mention all the documents and more documents i sent into them it was undeniable. to have your own identity questioned not once but over almost 6 months messes up a person’s psyche and self esteem and then to have my integrity questioned over and over it’s enough to destroy a person. i can see why so many people walk away. i can’t i have over $1000 invested into my store not to mention the amount of merchandise i own. now that i’ve figured out the email situation that they refuse to resolve or respond to. i’m now being told i have contacted them via using to many email addresses. blatant lie. i have only contacted them using one store address bc i had to specifically open and deactivate the account so i could contact customer service. as far as correspondence goes. i have requested over and over again that i only be contacted at one specific email address the one associated with my store. i keep getting dicfrent emails sent to various emails and i cannot stop this i just answer them as nicely as possible which sometimes is impossible. waiting on a response from account security in my mind i believe is the most incompetent set of workers i have ever delt with in forever. anyone that has touched my account or has been seriously responsible cor it over the past almost 6 months that lost it, transferred to the wting department,   didnt follow through with what they lromised just sat on it. or did anything wrong pediod needs to lose their job or put on probation until they learn  the correct way or follow through on promises. if not able to comply they all need be let go especially in account security department. since they were responsible all along. im seriously wanting to find leagal counsel to take on my case for pro bono i know this is a wining case that will pay out generously. i was lied too, mislead? my own identity doubted my integrity questioned, my business ruined and my reputation destroyed, my mental health extremely affected bc i have bipolar and major depression disorder and this entire situation has exacerbated both disorders extremely. i have lost an extreme amount of wages. my entire domain is wasted for this year they need to pay for next year as well as a year subscription with shopify and they definitely need to compensate me for my mental health trauma and torture. i have never been treated so terrible by any business in my entire life other than by shopify. do not suffer with them it will destroy your business reputation and everything you hold dear to you!",28 Jun 2025,1.0

Shopify,"small us based retailer here. recently i went to fulfil a low weight package in a poly mailer and was met with the usual options to select a service. generally in this case i would select usps ground advantage due to price and transit time. well, shopify defaulted to usps first class mail and i flubbed my mouse click to change prior to purchasing the label. no problem. i’ve done this before. i just need to void the label (and subsequently the order fulfillment) and re-fulfill it making sure to choose the correct service. i’ll get a credit for the first class mail purchase and the order will be neatly fulfilled.imagine my surprise when i went to void the transaction and saw the ‘void’ option was greyed out. weird. i guess i need do reach out to support. of course, sometime in the last 10 years since becoming a shopify merchant they decided to downgrade my subscription so i no longer can get phone support (somehow i’m paying more, but that’s another gripe). so, i have to fight the chat bot to chat with someone about the issue. taking me far more time than is needed to sort the issue out. anyway, i get a support agent who pokes around their resources (all the same ones i can easily search, and already have). they go back and forth with their ‘supervisor’. 45 mins to 1hr pass and i still don’t have an answer. they finally tell me that shopify no longer refunds usps first class mail purchases because usps does not allow refunds. ok. no one ever told us merchants about that change and there was no discernable warning during the label purchasing process that lets you know that is the case.but either way, fine. you keep the money. i can’t get a $4 refund. no big deal. now, how do i un-fulfill the order so i can purchase a new label to get the customer their order? well, turns out you can’t. what? so, i’m stuck with an order where i paid shipping, can’t sent the package out, and have no way to correct it? at this point i’m very frustrated and demand to speak to someone on the phone. they stonewall me, over and over. in the end the only ‘resolution’ is to create another ghost order and buy the correct shipping label. what an awful solution…anyway, consider this a warning to anyone who hasn’t discovered this ‘enhancement’ or to anyone considering shopify. you will not get phone support unless you are on their premium tier subscription which, lets face it, unless you’re a large merchant you’re going on that tier. if they treat their legacy customers like this, you are on your own.the platform is good, but man they have little respect for their customers.",25 Jun 2025,1.0

Shopify,"i rarely leave reviews, but after months of frustration with shopify, i feel obligated to warn other small business owners.1. horrible customer service:shopify's support is virtually nonexistent when you really need help. getting in touch with a human is like pulling teeth. when you finally do reach someone, you're met with generic, copy-paste responses that don’t actually solve your problem. it’s incredibly frustrating to run a business and be left hanging when your site or payment system isn’t working properly.2. everything costs extra:shopify markets itself as an all-in-one e-commerce platform, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. most of the features you'd expect to be included—basic discounting, advanced customization, google reviews and more—are locked behind expensive third-party apps or upgraded plans. these add-ons rack up fast. you’ll end up paying double or triple your base subscription fee just to get your store functioning properly.and shipping rates are no different than any other online service. save 33% on shipping rates is total bs!3. overpromised, underdelivered:the overall service feels hollow. the platform might look slick at first glance, but once you’re in it, it becomes clear that shopify is more interested in nickel-and-diming you than helping you succeed. there’s no real sense of community or support, and unless you’re a developer or willing to pay one, customizing anything beyond the basics is a nightmare.bottom line: shopify might work for some, but if you're a small or growing business expecting value and support, look elsewhere. there are better platforms with more included features, responsive customer service, and transparent pricing. shopify just isn't it.oh, and they'll shut you down in a heartbeat if you complain!!!",17 Jun 2025,1.0

Shopify,"we have been an online business for close to 20 years. after hearing all the hype around shopify, we moved our sizable business over to shopify plus under a 3-year contract. we spent a good portion of 12 months getting everything ready for the migration, speaking to numerous shopify sales reps, engineers and our onboarding manager all who confirmed that shopify had the ability to do what we needed it to do.  we gave them a long list of functions and were assured that either shopify could do it natively or there was an app that could do it.basic functions you'd expect an e-commerce platform to be able to do such as calculate shipping and order dispatch, product bundling and product variations, syncing to google shopping, syncing with myob to manage inventory levels etc all couldn't be done. it sounds so basic it is ridiculous to think that an e-commerce platform which is so widely used cannot perform such basic functions. it's like it's a basic system that works great if you're selling light weight products and can offer free shipping or use australia post, but anything oversize it can't handle. we tried numerous apps but it seems that each time we thought we figured out a workaround for 1 issue, another issue was created. after visibility and sales tanking and pleading with shopify to let us out of our contract (and them declining) we had no choice but to cut our losses (we're talking mid 6 figures). we were faced with the choice of losing our business and laying off 15 staff, or rebuild our site back on the platform we were using previously and hope we can turn things around. shopify's support once they had the signed contract was non-existent. they made promises and said their system plus apps could do everything we wanted, but once we were locked into a $2,000pm usd contract for 3 years, they didn't want to help. we are taking the matter to the accc. we've already lost enough without being locked into paying shopify for another 24 months. surely, the ability to generate an accurate shipping quote, dispatch orders, feed products into google shopping and integrate with myob is the bare basics of what an e-comm platform should be able to provide.",11 Jun 2025,1.0
